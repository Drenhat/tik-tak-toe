# Tik-tak-toe
## Description
> a simple tik tak toe project completed within MIT xPro certificate.

## Roadmap of Future Improvements
> Here are some ideas for future improvements:
> 1. When a user wins, we could fade the other squares and only keep the winning combo. This would be done using CSS. The color could be updated with an if statement.
> It would be possible to add a hover effect when the user hover a spectific square.
